							<h3>We take your privacy, and the safety of our users, very seriously.</h3>
								<p>

Please take the time to read our policy.
<br><br>
<strong>1. Sharing data</strong>
<br>
We disclose 0 bytes of personal user data to third parties, we never share your information with anyone. We may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personal information to authorised partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for curriculums and content. The objective is always to improve online learning and accomplish our mission.
<br><br>
By default your Undermind student profile is private, although you may choose to make it public. We strive to provide you with access to and control over the information you give us. We do not advertise. We use your information to provide you with a better learning experience, not to sell you products.
<br><br>
<strong>2. Storing data</strong>
<br><em>2.1 Personal information</em>
<br>
When you register for and use our application, you provide to Undermind what is generally called “personally identifiable information” (such as your full name and email address) that can be used to identify you. Undermind only stores the personal data it needs to function properly — for as long as you want Undermind to function. This information is primarily used to verify your award certificates upon reaching a certain level of expertise on our platform.
<br><br>
<em>Your e-mail address</em>
<br>
By default we enable 2-step-verification for your account, Undermind will prompt you for an email address to set up password recovery and as a destination for award certificates. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code, if you forget it. That’s right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.
<br><br>
<strong>2.2 Non-Personal Information</strong>
<br><em>Learning information</em>
<br>
We collect usage information about your use of certain features, such as the number of problems you’ve attempted, the number of videos you’ve viewed, and the amount of time spent to complete a problem. This enables us to improve your learning experience.
<br><br>
Participation in Online Courses. We use the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from you when you participate in an Online Course through the Site for processing purposes, including but not limited to tracking attendance, progress and completion of an Online Course. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information and your performance in a given Online Course with the instructor or instructors who taught the course, with teaching assistants or other individuals designated by the instructor or instructors to assist with the creation, modification or operation of the course, and with the institution or institutions with which they are affiliated. Also, we may archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you.
<br><br>
<em>Location information</em>
<br>
We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country) to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region. We do not collect the precise geolocation of you or your device. You should also be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location information.
<br><br>
<em>Chats</em>
<br>
Direct chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We also do not keep logs for messages longer than 15 days, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged. For the same reasons Undermind messages are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.
<br><br>
<strong>3. Deleting data</strong>
<br><em>Accounts</em>
<br>
If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your information. This action must be confirmed via your Undermind account and cannot be undone.
<br><br>
<em>Account self-destruction</em>
<br>
We value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Undermind and do not login for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with every other piece of data you store in the Undermind cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.
<br><br>
<strong>4. Payment information</strong>
<br>
Undermind relies on Stripe to process subscription payments from users. Stripe may issue Undermind a token that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.
<br><br>
Our privacy policy does not apply to payments made to external sources linked on our platform, when making an external purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider‘s server.
<br><br>
You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Undermind Settings > Privacy and Security and selecting ‘Clear Payment Details’. If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your payment tokens from all providers and ask the providers to remove your credit card information they store.
<br><br>
<strong>5. External websites</strong>
<br>
This privacy policy does not apply to websites and online services maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.
</p>
<strong>6. Government Authorities, Legal Rights and Actions. </strong>
<br>
Jinaverse may share your Personally Identifiable Information with government authorities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights or to protect our property; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also may share your Personally Identifiable Information when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Jinaverse, the Site, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.
</p>
<strong>7. Statement of Confidentiality and Security for Personally Identifiable Information </strong>
<br>
We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and secure and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information.
</p>
<strong>8. No Information from Children Under 13</strong>
<br>
Jinaverse strongly believes in protecting the privacy of children. In line with this belief, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information on our Site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is directed to persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access this Site at any time or in any manner. We will take appropriate steps to delete any Personally Identifiable Information of persons less than 13 years of age that has been collected on our Site without verified parental consent upon learning of the existence of such Personally Identifiable Information.
