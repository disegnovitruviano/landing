1.1.  Contract
<br><br>
You agree that by clicking “Start Learning”, "Register”, “Join Now”, “Join Undermind”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with Jinaverse (even if you are using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not click “Join Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services.
<br><br>
You are entering into this Contract with Jinaverse SAS (also referred to as “we” and “us”) and your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services is controlled by Jinaverse SAS, share capital 5 000 €, 9 rue Jean-Marie Jego, 75013 Paris, 830 768 842 RCS Paris.
<br><br>
1.2.  Our Services
<br><br>
This Contract applies to Undermind.io, Undermind-branded apps and other Undermind-related sites, apps, communications and services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”).
<br><br>
As some of our Services may be software that is downloaded to your computer, phone, tablet, or other device, you agree that we may automatically update this software, and that these Terms will apply to such updates.
<br><br>
• Course Modifications
To ensure the fair usage of the platform and the protection of our users and teachers, Jinaverse SAS reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, or reschedule all content. Courses offered are subject to the Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability sections below. As the community grows and the platform evolves, we reserve the right to update our ranking, experience and token reward systems.
<br><br>
• Academic Credit
Unless otherwise explicitly indicated by a credit-granting institution, participation in or completion of a course does not confer any academic credit. Even if credit is awarded by one institution, there is no presumption that other institutions will accept that credit. You agree not to accept credit for completing a course unless you have earned a Course Certificate (or other equivalent Undermind accreditation) for that course. Undermind, the class teachers, and the associated participating institutions have no obligation to have a course recognized by any educational institution or accreditation organization.
<br><br>
• Disclaimer of Student-University or Student-Teacher Relationship
Nothing in these Terms or otherwise with respect to your participation in any course: (a) establishes any relationship between you and any educational institution with which Jinaverse may be affiliated; (b) enrolls or registers you in any educational institution, or in any course offered by any educational institution; or (c) entitles you to use the resources of any educational institution beyond participation in the course.
<br><br>
1.3.  Change
<br><br>
We may modify this Contract from time to time. If we make material changes to it, we will provide you notice through your bot, or by any other means available to us, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms.
<br><br>
2.  Obligations
<br><br>
2.1.  Service Eligibility
<br><br>
Any use or access by anyone under the age of 13 is prohibited, and certain courses may have additional requirements and/or restrictions.
<br><br>
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the “Minimum Age” (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one Undermind account, which must be in your real name ; and (3) you are not already restricted by Undermind from using the Services.
<br><br>
Members who were below this new Minimum Age when they started using the Services under a previous User Agreement may continue to use them, as they have already reached the new Minimum Age since then or will reach it in the near future.
<br><br>
“Minimum Age” means 13 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Undermind to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.
<br><br>

2.2.  Your Account
<br><br>
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections) and (4) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
<br><br>

2.3.  Payment
<br><br>
If you buy any of our subscription, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
<br><br>
• Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).
<br>
• We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your Services.
<br>
• If you purchase a subscription, your payment method will be automatically charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your Premium Services.<br>
• All of your purchases of Services are subject to Undermind’s refund policy. <br>
• We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase. <br>
<br><br>
You can get a copy of your invoice through your Undermind account settings under “Purchase History”.
<br><br>

2.4.  Notices and Service Messages
<br><br>
You agree that we will provide notices to you in the following ways: (1) a notice within the Service, or (2) a message sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
<br><br>
Please review your settings to control and limit the messages you receive from us.
<br><br>

2.5.  Sharing
<br><br>
Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, slide decks, news articles, videos, online classes, job postings, InMails and blogs. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to Undermind connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your Undermind profile update).
<br><br>
3.  Rights and Limits
<br><br>
3.1.  Your License to Undermind
<br><br>

As between you and Jinaverse, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services and you are only granting Jinaverse the following non-exclusive license: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and process, information and content that you provide through our Services, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
<br><br>
• You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied, re-shared it or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
<br><br>
• Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.
<br><br>
You agree that we may access, store and use any information that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
<br><br>
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to Jinaverse, you agree that Jinaverse can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
<br><br>
You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. Jinaverse may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.
<br><br>

3.2.  Service Availability
<br><br>
We may change or discontinue any of our Services. We don’t promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you’ve posted.
<br><br>
Undermind is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
<br><br>

3.3.  Other Content, Sites and Apps
<br><br>
By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. Although Jinaverse generally reviews content provided by Subscribers, you agree that we are not responsible for others’ (including other Members’) content or information. We cannot always prevent the misuse of our services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse.
<br><br>
You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third party apps or sites that link from our Services. If you allow a third party app or site to authenticate you or connect with your Undermind account, that app or site can access information on Undermind related to you and your connections. Third party apps and sites have their own legal terms and privacy policies, and you may be giving others permission to use your information in ways we would not. Except to the limited extent it may be required by applicable law, Jinaverse is not responsible for these other sites and apps – use these at your own risk. Please see our Privacy Policy.
<br><br>



3.4.  Limits
<br><br>
To ensure the protection of our students and our community, Jinaverse reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. Jinaverse reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if Jinaverse believes that you may be in breach of this Contract or law or are misusing the Services (e.g. violating any Do and Don’ts).
<br><br>

3.5.  Intellectual Property Rights
<br><br>
Jinaverse reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Using the Services does not give you any ownership in our Services or the content or information made available through our Services.

Undermind, and Undermind logos and other Undermind trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Undermind.
<br><br>
4.  Privacy
<br><br>
We take your privacy extremely seriously, please take the time to read our policy. We also support the Student Privacy Pledge to safeguard student privacy.
<br><br>
4.1.  Sharing data
<br><br>
We disclose 0 bytes of personal user data to third parties, we never share your information with anyone. We may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personal information to authorised partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for curriculums and content. The objective is always to improve online learning and accomplish our mission.
By default your Undermind student profile is private, although you may choose to make it public. We strive to provide you with access to and control over the information you give us. We do not advertise. We use your information to provide you with a better learning experience, not to sell you products.
<br><br>
4.2.  Storing data
<br><br>
Personal information
<br>
When you register for and use our application, you provide to Undermind what is generally called “personally identifiable information” (such as your full name and email address) that can be used to identify you. Undermind only stores the personal data it needs to function properly — for as long as you want Undermind to function. This information is primarily used to verify your payment method and award certificates upon reaching a certain level of expertise on our platform.
<br><br>
Your e-mail address
<br>
By default we enable 2-step-verification for your account, Undermind will prompt you for an email address to set up password recovery and as a destination for award certificates. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code, if you forget it. That’s right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.
<br><br>
Identity Verification.
<br>
Jinaverse may offer you the ability to verify your identity (e.g., through the Signature Track or ACE-CREDIT courses) for selected classes or for grant applications. In order to enroll for these services, you are required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address, date of birth, a headshot taken using a webcam, a photo identification document, and a sample of your typing patterns. Additionally, if you apply for financial aid in connection with these services, you are required to provide information regarding your income.
<br><br>
Non-Personal Information
<br>
Learning information
<br>
We collect usage information about your use of certain features, such as the number of problems you’ve attempted, the number of videos you’ve viewed, and the amount of time spent to complete a problem. This enables us to improve your learning experience.
<br><br>
Participation in Online Courses. We use the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from you when you participate in an Online Course through the Site for processing purposes, including but not limited to tracking attendance, progress and completion of an Online Course. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information and your performance in a given Online Course with the instructor or instructors who taught the course, with teaching assistants or other individuals designated by the instructor or instructors to assist with the creation, modification or operation of the course, and with the institution or institutions with which they are affiliated. Also, we may archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you.
<br><br>
Location information
<br>
We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country) to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region. We do not collect the precise geolocation of you or your device. You should also be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location information.
<br><br>
Traffic information
<br>
We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site.
<br><br>
Chats
<br>
Direct chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We also do not keep logs for messages longer than 15 days, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged. For the same reasons Undermind messages are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.
<br><br>
4.3.  Deleting data
<br>
Accounts
<br>
If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your information. This action must be confirmed via your Undermind account and cannot be undone.
<br><br>
Account self-destruction
<br>
We value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Undermind and do not login for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with every other piece of data you store in the Undermind cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.
<br><br>
4.4.  Payment information
<br>
Undermind relies on Stripe to process subscription payments from users. Stripe may issue Undermind a token that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.
<br><br>
Our privacy policy does not apply to payments made to external sources linked on our platform, when making an external purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider‘s server.
<br><br>
You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Undermind Settings > Privacy & Security and selecting ‘Clear Payment Details’. If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your payment tokens from all providers and ask the providers to remove your credit card information they store.
<br><br>
4.5.  External websites
<br>
This privacy policy does not apply to websites and online services maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.
<br><br>

4.6.  Government Authorities, Legal Rights and Actions.
<br>
Jinaverse may share your Personally Identifiable Information with various government authorities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights or to protect our property; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases – although we will do our utmost not to - we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also may share your Personally Identifiable Information when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Jinaverse, the Site, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.

<br><br>
4.7.  Statement of Confidentiality & Security for Personally Identifiable Information
<br>
We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and secure and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information.
<br><br>
4.8.  No Information from Children Under 13
<br>
Jinaverse strongly believes in protecting the privacy of children. In line with this belief, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information on our Site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is directed to persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access this Site at any time or in any manner. We will take appropriate steps to delete any Personally Identifiable Information of persons less than 13 years of age that has been collected on our Site without verified parental consent upon learning of the existence of such Personally Identifiable Information.
<br><br>

<br><br>
5.2.  Exclusion of Liability
<br><br>
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW (AND UNLESS JINAVERSE HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), JINAVERSE AND ITS AFFILIATES (AND THOSE THAT JINAVERSE WORKS WITH TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION, PROFITS OR REVENUES, RELATED TO THE SERVICES (E.G. OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS, DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT).
<br><br>
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LIABILITY OF JINAVERSE AND ITS AFFILIATES (AND THOSE THAT JINAVERSE WORKS WITH TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES) EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS, AN AMOUNT THAT IS THE LESSER OF (A) FIVE TIMES THE MOST RECENT MONTHLY OR YEARLY FEE THAT YOU PAID FOR A PREMIUM SERVICE, IF ANY, OR (B) US $1000.
<br><br>
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND JINAVERSE AND SHALL APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS OF LIABILITY (E.G. WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, CONTRACT, LAW) AND EVEN IF JINAVERSE OR ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN TOLD OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF THESE REMEDIES FAIL THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
<br><br>
SOME LAWS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, SO THESE LIMITS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br><br>
6.  Termination
<br><br>
Both you and Jinaverse may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:

We both agree that all of these claims can only be litigated in Paris, France, and we each agree to personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Paris, France.
<br><br>

8.  General Terms
<br><br>
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract. To the extent allowed by law, the English language version of this Contract is binding and other translations are for convenience only. This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
<br><br>
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that Jinaverse has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Contract.
<br><br>
We reserve the right to change the terms of this Contract and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.
